## What is this?

A "fork" of https://github.com/rstacruz/startup-name-generator

## Why?

I had trouble getting `yarn build` to run when using that as a dependency.
Ran into [this issue of failing ot minify](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).

One suggestion is to move the code into your own `src` directory, which is what I
did here.
